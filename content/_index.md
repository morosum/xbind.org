![Understory bryophyte layer in a subalpine forest](https://storage.live.com/items/D70A892E0DD05FA3!2839?authkey=AKNCRUpelpMuI5U)

This is Xin Liu's personal website. 

I am broadly interested in plant ecology, forest ecology, and terrestrial ecosystem processes. My research works are mainly focused on the role of understory plant assemblages, especially mosses, in the primary production and nutrient cycling of subalpine forests. Most of the researches are implemented in subalpine forests on the eastern Tibetan Plateau and upper reaches of the Yangtze River.

The picture above shows the understory plant assemblage of subalpine coniferous forests in the eastern Tibetan Plateau, where bryophytes are ubiquitous and critical in regulating biogeochemical cycles.
