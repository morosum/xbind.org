This is Xin Liu. 

I am broadly interested in plant ecology, forest ecology, and terrestrial ecosystem processes. Researches concern the cycling of nutrients, biodiversity conservation, and vegetation restoration of mountainous areas. Most of researches are implemented in subalpine forest ecosystem on eastern Tibetan Plateau and upper reaches of the Yangtze River.

The website was build via [blogdown](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), and published by [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). During building the website, I profited a lot form Yihui's book on [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/), Alison Presmanes Hill's [tutorial](https://alison.rbind.io/post/up-and-running-with-blogdown/), [Daijiang's](https://daijiang.name/), [Likan's](https://likan.info/), and [Liechi's](http://liechi.org/) blogs.
