My researches are mainly implemented in subalpine spruce or fir forest ecosystem on eastern Tibetan Plateau. The forest ecosystems are important in provides numerous vital services, such as nutrient cycling, biodiversity conservation, water regulation and supply, and climate regulation. 

Forest ecosystems face multiple anthropogenic threats in both the past and present. For instance, disturbances form forest harvest and afforestation can result in multiple dirvers of forest changes. Thus, I examine the patterns of changes in understory plant assemblages in responses to forest harvest.

Understory byrophyte layer is an important but often overlooked component of the forest integrity, and is crucial in forest ecosystem function, such as nutrient cycling. I examine the nutrient use strategy of main understory moss species with an *in situ* experiment.

I use both observational studies and manipulative experiments to test ecological theory and provide applied information for forest management and biodiversity conservation.

## Response of understory plant assemblage to anthropogenic disturbance

Understory plant communities are crucial for forest functioning. They play important roles in providing habitats and food for insects and other animals, recycling nutrients, sustaining ecosystem productivity and stability, and holding much of the biodiversity. Understory plant communities are influenced by overstory type and canopy structure attributes such as cover and tree density. Furthermore, these factors are substantially affected by stand-replacing disturbances, among which clear-cut logging is one of the severest anthropogenic disturbances. Thus, the understory of forest communities undergoes extensive changes immediately after clear-cutting.

We implemented a before–after, control–impact (BACI) designed experiment in a high-elevation, old-growth spruce forest in the eastern Tibetan Plateau to understand the response of the understory plant community, as well as the driving roles of environmental alteration (e.g., radiation, temperature, humidity, and nutrients), physical disturbance (e.g., direct damage by trampling and tree-felling). We found that the short-term responses of understory vegetation to clear-cutting are distinct across different assemblages due to various mechanisms. Bryophytes are more sensitive than vascular plants, and cover percentage responded more swiftly than species richness to clear-cutting.

## Nutrient use of understory mosses

Mosses comprise most of the understory in subalpine and boreal coniferous forests. They are assumed to be critical regulator of biogeochemical cycles in the forest ecosystems. Despite their high abundance in many ecosystems, it is still largely unknown how efficient mosses are in using and recycling nutrients, as well as the rate of mosses lose nutrient to the ecosystem via e.g. leaching.

Moss differ from vascular plants in both biology and ecology, such as lacking highly specialized conducting tissue and having leaves one cell thick. Because of these unique physiological and ecological characteristics, bryophytes serve as effcetive traps for water and nutrients in atmospheric deposition. These features, on the other hand, lead to the possibility of losing nutrients during changes in the microclimate such as sudden rain events. 

To aid in understanding the N dynamics of mosses, we established and tested a conceptual framework describing the possible pathways that mosses recycle or lose N during senescence. We followed the fate of N in two dominant mosses using stable isotopes <sup>15</sup>N in old-growth fir forests in the eastern Tibetan Plateau. Unlike previously hypothesized, I found that the 2 mosses are efficient in N resorption. Nitrogen leaching from live tissue is an important but often overlooked pathway that the mosses release N.
